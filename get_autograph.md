# Pizza Planet Adventure
## Get the Autograph

Unable to resist the allure of Zorboncé, your heart pulls you towards Zorboncé and her star-shaped pen. The contentment of the surrounding crowd softens as everyone's gaze is upon you and Zorboncé.

With the pressure of being in front of the very Zorboncé, you reach for anything within arm's reach for her to sign. The first thing you see is the pizza box of the pizza you're delivering.

Without a second thought, you snatch the pizza box as fast as alienly possible and offer it to Zorboncé. With the utmost grace, her star-shaped pen glides across the cardboard box leaving behind a sparkly trail of space ink. The once meaningless pizza box has been transformed into a piece of space history. The crowd bursts into applause and camera flashes fill the air.

You hug the autographed pizza box close to you.

> Thank you, Zorboncé! This means the galaxy to me!

Zorboncé nods and smiles. She extends another tentacle, offering you a small device. It resembles a space communicator, adorned with the Zorboncé insignia. She offers you one last smile before retreating back into the crowd. The crowd recedes into the distance, the excitement and flashes now echoing throughout the station. 

You feel a buzz in your hand. 

The space communicator lights up with a holographic message displaying:

> Zorboncé: Stay connected, Cosmic friend. Our paths in the galaxy may cross again.

A wave of excitement and anticipation hits you as you reflect on your encounter. Your future holds a lot more than just carrying out your measly pizza delivery duties. Just as that thought occurs, the persistent beeping of your pizza cruiser snaps you back to reality. You're over 10 minutes behind on your pizza delivery, when your average delivery speed is 10 minutes!
