As you rev up your trusty pizza cruiser, you decide to take the fast route through the Nebula Express, eager to break delivery time records and earn the title of the "Galactic Speedster." The Nebula Express is known for its treacherous and unpredictable nebula clouds, but you're determined to prove your skills as a fearless delivery person.

As you zoom through the dense, swirling Nebula clouds, your confidence begins to waver. Visibility is extremely poor, and the navigation systems on your cruiser struggle to keep up. You push your ship to the limits, trying to maintain your course and deliver pizzas on time. Suddenly, you hear a loud bang, and alarms blare as your cruiser is hit by a rogue asteroid. Panic sets in as you lose control of your ship, spiraling into the dense nebula.

Desperately trying to regain control, you crash into a space station within the Nebula Express, causing a catastrophic accident. The pizzas are ruined, and the space station's residents are furious at the chaos you've caused. Your reputation as a reckless delivery person spreads across the galaxy, and your dreams of becoming the "Galactic Speedster" are shattered. You are fired.
