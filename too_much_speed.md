# Pizza Planet Adventure

## Too Much Speed

You thought long and hard about what kind of delivery person you wanted to be. It really boils down to whether you want to be the employee of the month or enjoy your time with the quirky customers. Obviously, you want to be a *Galactic Speedster* at *Cosmic Crust*, so you can boast about it on your resume!

You hop on your stylish pizza cruiser and step on the gas all the way...

The space cruiser hurtled through the cosmos at an astonishing velocity, pushing the boundaries of its propulsion systems to the limit. 
The intense gravitational forces and erratic celestial phenomena causes severe strain on the cruiser's hull, resulting in alarming structural damage. Alarms blared, and emergency lights flickered as you struggle to regain control. Sparks and pizza boxes fly everywhere.

You make an emergency landing on the nearest planet. Your cruiser, and your customers' pizzas, aren't going anywhere until you can repair it.
