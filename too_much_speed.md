# Pizza Planet Adventure

## Too Much Speed

Embarking on your sleek pizza conveyance, you rev up the engine, propelling yourself forward with determination.

As the space cruiser rockets through the boundless expanse of the cosmos, it surges forward at a breathtaking speed, challenging the very capabilities of its propulsion systems. The relentless gravitational forces and capricious celestial phenomena exert immense pressure on the cruiser's hull, leading to alarming structural damage. Amidst blaring alarms and flickering emergency lights, you find yourself in a frantic struggle to regain control. Sparks dance through the air, and pizza boxes take flight in the chaos.

With a sense of urgency, you manage to execute an emergency landing on the closest planet within reach. The cruiser, along with the precious cargo of your customers' pizzas, is now grounded, waiting for your expert touch to repair the damage before it can soar back into the cosmic abyss. The fate of your interstellar delivery adventure lies in your hands as you prepare to tackle the challenges that await on this unfamiliar celestial terrain.
