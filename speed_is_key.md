# Pizza Planet Adventure

## Speed is Key

You thought long and hard about what kind of delivery person you wanted to be. It really boils down to whether you want to be the employee of the month or enjoy your time with the quirky customers. Obviously, you want to be a *Galactic Speedster* at *Cosmic Crust*, so you can boast about it on your resume!

You hop on your stylish pizza cruiser and step on the gas all the way. You decide to go on the highway and go 50 km/h over the speed limit. Oh no, the cops are after you, and the most sensible thing to do is to flee. How can you get a speeding ticket on your first day at work? If the cops don't catch you, then you won't get a ticket, right? You are now going 100 km/h over the speed limit, and you find it difficult to avoid the vehicles in front of you. Out of pure fear, you drive outside the highway and you are off road. Yay! The police are not following you anymore, but your GPS stops working. Nobody drives outside of the space passages, mainly because there is no signal, and it's harder to get to other planets. Damn, you are faced with a dilemma.

Space is quite a scary place; it is completely silent, and the darkness feels like it's closing in, with fear and overthinking creeping in. **BAM**, you jump out of your seat. In utter horror, you slowly turn your head to the window. A crusty pizza cruiser bumped into my cruiser, it looked so old, you don't recall anyone in the company driving this. The person inside signaled to the radio.

Another Delivery Man?
> Hi, your pizza cruiser seems brand new; you must be a newbie.

You
> Hello, yes, I accidentally left the highway, and I don't know how to get back. Are you also working at *Cosmic Crust*?

Another Delivery Man?
> Ah, um... yes yes. I'm on vacation right now and I forgot to return the cruiser haha...

You
> Oh okay! Do you think you can help me, please?

Another Delivery Man?
> Oh, I see. Of course, I can help you. Cosmic Crust is all about family!

You
> THANK YOU SO MUCH!!

Another Delivery Man?
> No problem! By the way, how much fuel do you have?

You
> I still have 100%.

Another Delivery Man?
> OH GOOD, my fuel is going to run out. Can we stop at the moon, and can you give me some of your fuel? I can help you get home after that.

You
> Yes, yes, anything for my savior.

Another Delivery Man?
>Nice... follow me

You and the other delivery man drive to the moon. As you land, you get out of your car and go to your trunk to get the fuel transfer tube. Footsteps echoed in the lunar silence, you assume the delivery man is going to help you. **THUD**, the delivery man smashes a stone to your head. You died.

### Epilogue 

After the so called delivery man smashes your head, he proceeds to dump your body into your cruiser's trunk. He hops into the cruiser and drives off, leaving the crusty one behind. You are the second victim of his crimes, as his first victim was a previous *Cosmic Crust* employee. That employee also wanted to be the Galactic Speedster, but this man didn't want anyone to achieve that goal. This murderer had one goal only, to make sure that *Cosmic Crust* has a downfall, since the killer used to be the CEO of the company. He was full of vengance from the moment Mr. X AE A-XII Musk stole his position, and kicked him out of the company using his money. Till this day, he will kill every employee who tries to be the Galactic Speedster until the company burns to the ground.
